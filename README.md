This was an application built with Ruby to simulate a blackjack game with a dealer. In order to simplifiy the code and make it easier to ready the application was separated into three components. In order to run the game in your terminal clone the repo then enter /lib folder and run the command:

<h2>ruby blackjack.rb</h2>
